TITLE: THE HARDIGAN BROTHERS vs THE MEXICAN DRUG CARTEL
VERSION: 0.1 – CONCEPT + NARRATIVE + ASSET SPEC

LORE / TONE OVERVIEW
--------------------
A dark-comedy, South Park / Adult Swim–style **point-and-click slideshow adventure** where:
- The **Hardigan Brothers** (HANK and JONAH) are wannabe teen detectives in Northern Virginia.
- Their chill, undocumented neighbors are suddenly raided by ICE.
- The brothers’ choices pull them into a spiraling mess with:
  - A Mexican drug cartel faction
  - US Feds (ICE, FBI, CIA, shadow “Special Projects” unit)
  - Venezuelan political players loyal to Maduro
  - Colombian smugglers and a gang called “Tren de Agua”

The game satirizes:
- US immigration policy and ICE optics
- The War on Drugs
- Cable-news brain rot
- TikTok geopolitics “experts”
- Conspiracy culture

We’re mocking systems, institutions, and media hysteria — **not** entire nationalities or everyday people.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TARGET PLAYTIME

~30 minutes for a single playthrough, with multiple branches and endings.

TECH + IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRONTEND: (index.html styles.css)

  - Character slide-in/out (transform/opacity)
  - Light toggles (layer masks / brightness filters)
  - Screen shake (for explosions, raids, etc.)

STATE MANAGEMENT: (index.js) 
- Global state object:
  - currentSceneId
  - inventory: [ "house_key", "neighbors_usb", ... ]
  - flags: { HELPED_ICE: true/false, HELPED_NEIGHBORS: true/false, CARTEL_ALLY: false, ... }
- Save system:
  - LocalStorage JSON snapshot: { currentSceneId, inventory, flags, timestamp }.
  - CONTINUE loads last snapshot.
