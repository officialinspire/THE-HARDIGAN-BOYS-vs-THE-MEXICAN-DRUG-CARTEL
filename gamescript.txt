- The USB could prove:
  - (A) they’re innocent OR
  - (B) they’re small cogs in a big machine.

   - → Complex branching in final showdown.

   - CARTEL sees them as a threat.
   - FLAG: CARTEL_TARGET = true.

BACKGROUND MUSIC: Safehouse Ambience.mp3

========================================================
S7B_CARTEL_TARGETING – “Snitches with Sneakers”
========================================================

BACKGROUND MUSIC: 

========================================================
S8_PRE_FINAL – “Everyone Wants a Piece”
========================================================
Staging scenes: travel, short montages (can be implemented as quick slideshow cards with minimal interactions).

Possible variants:
- Airport-type setting (cartel smuggling route).
- River dock (Tren de Agua)
- Venezuelan consulate backroom (Ortega ranting about imperialism, cartels, and crypto).

Each variant should:
- Give 1–2 key choices influencing who shows up in final scene.
- Update flags like:
  - ALLIED_WITH_ORTEGA
  - ALLIED_WITH_LUPITA
  - DOUBLE_CROSSED_SOMEONE

BACKGROUND MUSIC: 

========================================================
S9_FINAL_WAREHOUSE_SHOWDOWN – “Diplomacy, but Make It Stupid”
========================================================
BACKGROUND:
- bg_warehouse_night.png

CHARACTERS present vary depending on flags:

  - CARTEL BOSS + henchmen.
  - MS. GRAY + Special Ops.

CLICKABLES:
- [CRATE] – can hide, find weapons, or trigger explosion.
- [CONTROL_PANEL] – turn off lights, cause chaos.
- [MEGAPHONE] – talk to everyone at once.
- [USB_ON_TABLE] – central MacGuffin.

CORE DESIGN:
- Multiple dialogue rounds where the player:
  - Chooses who to side with publicly.
  - Chooses whether to leak data to press.
  - Chooses whether to destroy USB, copy it, or auction it.

KEY CHOICES IN FINALE:
1) Destroy USB:
   - “No one gets to weaponize this.”
   - CARTEL/ CIA/ everyone angry.
   - Depending on allies, they might escape or get killed.

2) Upload data to public:
   - Use fx_mobile_notification, tv overlays, etc.
   - Social media + press chaos.
   - Could trigger CHAOTIC or IRONIC MEDIA ending.

3) Secretly copy, then fake destroy:
   - Keep leverage.
   - Potential HAPPIER but morally gray ending.
